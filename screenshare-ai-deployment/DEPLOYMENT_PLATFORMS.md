# Deployment Options for Screen Sharing App

Your app requires WebSocket support for real-time communication. Here are the best hosting platforms:

## Recommended: Railway (Free with WebSocket support)

**Why Railway is best for this app:**
- Full WebSocket support
- Free tier with sufficient resources
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Built-in environment variable management

**Deploy to Railway:**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with your GitHub account
3. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Add environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
6. Deploy automatically

## Alternative: Render (Free tier)

**Deploy to Render:**
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Connect GitHub account
3. Create new "Web Service"
4. Select your repository
5. Set build command: `npm run build`
6. Set start command: `npm start`
7. Add environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Why NOT Vercel for this app:

Vercel is optimized for static sites and serverless functions. Your app needs:
- Persistent WebSocket connections
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Session state management

These features require a traditional server environment that platforms like Railway and Render provide.

## GitHub Repository Setup

To prepare for deployment:

1. Create new repository on GitHub
2. Clone this Replit project locally or download source
3. Push code to your GitHub repository
4. Connect repository to Railway or Render
5. Add your OpenAI API key as environment variable
6. Deploy

The app will work perfectly on Railway or Render with full WebSocket support for screen sharing.
